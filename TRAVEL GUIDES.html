<P>Before setting off for any trip or travel, knowing the tips or guide about accomodation, tour and travel is very crusual to be explained about by the tour guides to the tourists and ensure they are understood properly. This hepls them to condact them selves while at the sites in order to avoid accidents and ensure safety of their lives and everything as requied while at the site. <br>
The tips are in several asspects but these are as explained below.
<H4><P style="color:red"><B>A. TREVEL GUIDES, TIPS AND REQUIRMENTS</B></p></H4>
<ol>
<li style="color:blue"><u><b>Travel tips and advise:</b></u></li>
<p>This section likely incluides general tips fro travelers like;
<p style="color:red">
<b>(a). Packaging essentials. </b></p>These are in for of a bag that can be used to curry your lagage, and every thing you may need to use while at the sites or during the travel like water bottles, digital camera, fast aid kit among othe items important for every tourist as shall be listed as we procede down wards.

<p style="color:red"><b>(b). safety precautions.</b></p>This is in various forms like as an individual tourist or for the betternes of the while group as well. This includes;
<br><p>i. The tourist should not provoc the animals while in a zoo or a game park.
<p>ii. The tourist should not go for swimming carelessly just after seeing a large muss of water with out the permission or confirmation of the tour guide.
<p>iii. The tourist is not supposed or allowed to go and bathe in the water of a water fall as in a way of under minding the weight of the water or the mass of the water not untill the toir guide has comfirmed that the water is safe for bathing or showering because some water cause skin rushes.<br>
<p>iv. No tourist is allowed to touch any kind of wild animal with out the proper permission of the tour guide.
<p>v. every tourist must be able to walk for atleast one killometer. This is important especially when navigating plces like mountains and forest that an thick and have no roads constructed through to allow the vehicles to move therefore the only means of transport is by foot. therefore every tourist is advised to do some physical execise for atleast one month inorder to be fit for the touring and exploitation exercise.<br>
<p>vi. little has been explained and mentioned above but those are just the essentual but the most sensitive and important ones shall be givven and trust me they differ according to the tourist site visited, and the breifing is always had every morning about the place to be visited informing about the dangerous places and areas of precaution of the tourist site to be visited that day. This is always done to ensure safety fo all of us.

<li style="color:blue"><u><b>Transportation</b> </u></li>

<li style="color:blue"><b>Accomodation: </b></li>
<p>The places where to stay really differ according to the class of tourists and the place to be visited and these are planned for immediately after the touirist has submitted if the application for and the  fees required.
<br>There are several kinds of hotes that we constructed all over the world on most of the tourist sites all over the world in order to solve the issue of accomudation. These are world class accomodation facilities including lounges, hotels in the name or ranade tours and travel. <br>These are allowed to host at most 30% of non-tourist guests but only those of higher class in order to provide a conducive evvironment for the classic tourists that may be put in those kinds of places while touring nomatter the number they are in. <br>The rooms are sound proofed as in a way of emphasising the issue of conducive environment for each of every person in.
<br> They are self contained appartments and have air conditioners every where and every thing required fo a classic house.
<br>Countries with this kind of special buildings include:
<b>
<br>i. China
<br>ii. USA
<br>iii. Australia  
<br>iv. India
<br>v. England
